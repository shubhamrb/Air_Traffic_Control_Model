ATC-pie saves your settings in this directory:
- general and system settings in "settings.ini" and "text-chat-messages.ini"
- airport-specific settings in the "ad" directory (by location code)
- CTR-specific settings in the "ctr" directory (by location code)
- defined CTR radar positions in "CTR-positions.ini"
- saved window and dock geometry in the binary file "dock_layout"

You may customise display colours by editing the "colours.ini" file generated
on first run, even while the program is running and reload them from the system
menu. Empty lines and comment lines (starting with '#') will be ignored.

You may also specify a list of additional viewers to register on startup. When
activated from the view menu, registered viewers are sent the same traffic
packets as the controllable tower viewer. List one host+port address per line
in a file called "additional-viewers.ini", separating host and port with
whitespace. Each address should correspond to a running FlightGear instance set
up to receive FGMS packets on the specified port. Additional viewers can also
be registered at run-time; use the start-up file for viewers you use regularly.

It is safe to delete files here, e.g. to restore defaults, but the directory
itself should not be deleted.
