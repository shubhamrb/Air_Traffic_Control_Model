Local CTR settings are stored here by location code.

To revert the settings saved for a CTR location "XXX", delete the matching
"XXX.ini" file. To delete a CTR location and its code from the list of known
locations, edit "CTR-positions.ini" in the parent directory and remove the
appropriate line.
