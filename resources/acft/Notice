This directory contains four editable files.


1. "acft-db"

This file lists aircraft designators with associated info on the aircraft type.
Each line is made of 4 whitespace-separated values:
 - aircraft type designator, e.g. "C172"
 - X-plane category, i.e. "props", "turboprops", "heavy", "jets" or "helos"
 - wake turbulence category, i.e. "L", "M", "H" or "J"
 - typical cruise speed (integer value in knots)

Except for the type designator, a value can be replaced with a "-" to signify
an unknown or non-applicable value.


2. "tail-numbers"

This file specifies aircraft registration number formats, a.k.a. "tail numbers",
used to randomise non-commercial callsigns for solo and teacher traffic.

In this file, aside from empty lines and line comments (#), each line contains a
possible template string in which:
 - every "@" character is replaced with a random letter (A-Z);
 - every "%" character is replaced with a random decimal number digit (0-9);
 - every "*" character is replaced with either a letter or a digit;
 - every other character is copied verbatim.

For example, line "X-%%@@" (without the quotes) will generate callsigns made of
a "X-" prefix followed by two number digits and two letters.


3. "fgfs2icao"

ATC-pie looks in this file to find ICAO aircraft type designators for the
connected FlightGear models in multi-player sessions. Aside from empty lines and
line comments (#), each line must start with a regular expression matching the
model strings to recognise, and end with a whitespace-separated token that is
either:
 - a type designator to recognise an aircraft, e.g. "C172";
 - the 4-character token ":ATC" to recognise an ATC client (NB: no need to
   specify a regexp for ATC-pie clients as they already recognise each other).


4. "icao2fgfs"

In this file, you control the FlightGear models used to render the artificial
traffic generated in teaching and solo sessions. It should contain header
lines, each specifying a model for an ICAO ACFT type designator:
ICAO_dez  FG_model_file

Under each header line, you may insert a number of model specification lines
from the list below (the first token is literal):
 :height   value   # height of the model's origin from the wheels, in feet
 :airline  ICAO_code  FG_livery_string   # any number of these is OK
