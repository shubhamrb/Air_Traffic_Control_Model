== resources/elev ==

This directory contains ground elevation maps, used for more accurate
rendering of taxiing and landing AI traffic in the viewers. There may
be one file (ICAO.elev) per location, which is loaded on session start.

After optional empty or comment lines (#), an elevation map file must
contain a header line with the coordinates of the NW and SE corners of
the covered zone. The lines immediately following the header are elevation
plots in feet AMSL, distributed as equally spaced in both dimensions over
the zone. So the more values provided, the finer the precision.

These lines must all have the same number of values; elevation in one point
is then retrieved via a bilinear interpolation between the four closest values.

For example:
37.6311,-122.3965  37.6096,-122.3564
	1.1  2.2  .22
	.98  3.1  2.5

NB: If you have "fgelev" (a tool that comes with any FlightGear installation),
you can use the provided "mkElevMap.py" script. It will generate a map in the
"output" directory, given corner coordinates and a precision value.

When no elevation map is found for an airport, the field elevation value
is used everywhere on the ground. This should be OK for a rough approximation
on flat terrain, but ground traffic will not follow any slopes, thus may
appear as floating above the ground, or digging into it.
