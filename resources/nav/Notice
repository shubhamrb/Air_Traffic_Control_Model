In this directory, you may deposit six different spec files:
  1. "custom_navaid" to override the default data for navaids (VOR, NDB...);
  2. "custom_fix" to override the default data for fixes and RNAV points;
  3. "custom_awy" to override the default data for airways;
  4. "custom_ad" to customise the world airport positions and names;
  5. "route-presets" to specify routes for easy recall in FPLs and strips;
  6. "AD-entry-exit" for airport entry/exit points (enables route suggestions).

Files 1 through 3 must follow the X-plane 10 format for files "earth_nav.dat",
"earth_fix.dat" and "earth_awy.dat", respectively.

File 4 contains a world-wide list of airport names and positions, one per line:
  ICAO  lat,lon  Airfield long name
It must end with a line containing a single integer count of all entries.

In file 5, any number of route presets can be listed for every pair of end
airports (origin, destination). Using white space as the first two separators,
each line is of the form:
  ICAO_1 ICAO_2  route saved from origin ICAO_1 to destination ICAO_2

File 6 is a list of entry and exit points connecting airports to the world
airway network, used by ATC-pie when suggesting routes. Each line is of either
either following form, "entry" and "exit" being fixed tokens (verbatim):
  ICAO_DEP exit  navpoint  [optional leg spec before navpoint, e.g. "SID"]
  ICAO_ARR entry navpoint  [optional leg spec after navpoint, e.g. "STAR"]
