This is where to place your custom airport data files, named after their
respective ICAO codes as follows: "ICAO.dat". They should follow the X-plane
"apt.dat" format.

Fresh source files for airports can be found on the X-plane gateway, directly
accessible from the system menu. Alternatively, you may touch up the included
data, e.g. to modify a single radio frequency or parking position label. To do
this, edit the extracted file for the airport (see "resources/apt.extract") and
save it here with the right extension.

If you mess up an airport and are unable to clean its spec, just delete the
corresponding file here to revert to the default state.
