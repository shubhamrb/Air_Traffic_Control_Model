== resources/apt.extract ==

When airport data is needed and no custom source is provided, ATC-pie extracts
a default specification from a huge world-wide source file, and saves it here
for quicker access in later runs.

If you customise extracted files, avoid losing your specs on clean-up by moving
and renaming the edited files:
- see "resources/apt" for individual airport specs (named by ICAO code);
- see "resources/nav" for world locations and names ("AD-positions-names").

It is safe to delete files here; they will be generated again next time they
are needed. The directory itself should not be deleted.
