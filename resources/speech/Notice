
== resources/speech ==

This directory contains the pronunciation data for speech recognition and
synthesis, respectively for voice instructions and pilot read-back in solo
sessions.

Its editable items are:
- "airline-callsigns.phon" (file)
- "navpoints" (directory with customisable contents)

The former specifies airline radio callsigns, for example "Speedbird" for
British Airways. The list of airline codes in the file is the one used to
generate callsigns when spawning traffic in solo sessions, and to suggest
callsigns for teacher-created traffic.

The latter allows to specify the pronunciation of navpoint names (see Notice
file in the "navpoints" directory). Note that you can always refer to navpoints
by spelling out their short code using the standard aviation alpha-numericals.

Each line in a pronunciation file must specify three values separated by pipe
('|') characters. The three values are, in order:
1. the code for the entry (ICAO airline code or navpoint short name);
2. a text-to-speech string allowing virtual pilots to read out the entry;
3. whitespace-separated phonemes expected by the acoustic model.
