== resources/speech/navpoints ==

In this directory, you can specify the pronunciation of navpoint names for
recognition and synthesis in solo sessions when voice instructions or read-backs
are in use.

List the navpoints in respective "XXXX.phon" files, where XXXX is the code of
the location where they should be recognised. See "resources/speech/Notice" for
a description of the expected format of these files.
